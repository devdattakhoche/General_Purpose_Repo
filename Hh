In retrospect, I am pleased to provide a comprehensive overview of my contributions to our organization's success over the past year. My responsibilities encompassed modernization efforts, the resolution of functional issues, and project management that extended beyond our regular business activities.

Ownership and Assumption of NextGen EMEA Server-Side Responsibility

A significant aspect of my role was taking full ownership of server-side operations for NextGen EMEA, which took me around 9 months to do so.  This encompassed the prompt resolution of issues, proactive support for production environments, the implementation of new features, and meticulous oversight of migrations. I ensured that every task, regardless of its scale, was executed with unwavering attention to detail.

Multifaceted Contributions

In addition to my core responsibilities, I actively contributed to Greenlight (GL) and some NewGem action items. This highlights my commitment to a diverse range of responsibilities and initiatives throughout the organization.

AWS Solutions Architect Certification

A noteworthy achievement during this period was the successful completion of the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. Importantly, this accomplishment did not disrupt my regular work responsibilities, further illustrating my dedication to professional development.

Modernization

I took full responsibility for the migration of NextGen EMEA from Sybase to Aurora MySQL, orchestrating a seamless transition without disruptions.
The migration was meticulously planned and executed, ensuring a smooth shift without any significant production disruptions.
Key milestones were achieved within specified timelines, including the migration of database schemas and stored procedures.
In addition to database migration, I also oversaw the successful migration of stored procedures designed for reporting (GREP), contributing to system modernization.
To preempt issues, I implemented proactive monitoring post-deployment.

IDA Migration for NewGem

I led the migration of the Pyxis Service from Janus to IDA, a critical step in the Janus decommission and IDA migration project.
The Pyxis migration was executed without issues, with provisions for reverting to Janus in case of unforeseen complications.
Furthermore, I contributed to the CRS IDA migration, with the changes ready for activation once downstream blockers are resolved.

Technology Upgrades

We strategically upgraded NextGen EMEA from Java 8 to Java 11 to align with the evolving technology landscape and facilitate the migration from AWS Sybase to Aurora MySQL.
My role in the NextGen EMEA Cron to Watchdog migration significantly contributed to a successful transition.

In my role, a significant focus has been on ensuring the timely delivery of projects by effectively managing priorities and meeting business expectations regarding project schedules. This commitment to project management and business satisfaction has been at the forefront of my responsibilities.

This approach creates a stakeholder-friendly environment where their concerns are promptly and effectively addressed, ensuring a smooth and trouble-free experience for all stakeholders.

This client-centric and quality-driven approach has resulted in successful project deliveries and enhanced operate and trader satisfaction.
